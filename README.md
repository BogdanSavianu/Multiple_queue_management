The objective of this project was to create an app that finds the fastest time for n customers to be processed in a given number of queues, each queue running on its own separate thread. In addition to this, the events are logged in a .txt file and also displayes on-screen in a dynamic GUI that updates every second, showing the customers in each of the queues and displaying the progress of each queue in its respective progress bar.
